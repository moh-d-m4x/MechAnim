# MechAnim: Character Motion Designer

![MechAnim Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moh-d-m4x/MechAnim/refs/heads/main/ref/MechAnim_Dashboard.PNG)

**MechAnim** is a powerful web-based tool for designing, simulating, and optimizing mechanical linkages and character motion. It combines interactive 2D physics simulation with genetic algorithms to help users create complex mechanisms that follow specific motion paths.

## 🚀 Features

### 🛠️ Interactive Mechanism Design
- **Multiple Mechanism Types**: Support for 4-bar, 5-bar, Piston, and Scotch Yoke mechanisms.
- **Drag-and-Drop Editor**: Intuitively adjust link lengths, anchor points, and joint positions directly on the canvas.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Visualize motion instantly as you modify the design.
- **Parametric Controls**: Fine-tune specific values like crank length, ground distance, and speed ratios.

### 🧬 AI-Powered Optimization
- **Path Drawing**: Draw a desired motion path directly on the canvas.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Automatically evolve mechanism configurations to match your drawn path.
- **Smart Generation**: Uses Monte Carlo search and evolutionary strategies to find the best fit.
- **Shape Preservation**: Optimization algorithms respect the "DNA" of mechanism types, preserving speed ratios and key characteristics while fitting the curve.

### ✍️ Manual Motion Tracking
- **Import Video/GIF**: Upload reference footage of motion.
- **Manual Annotation**: Click and drag to define points on video frames.
- **Path Smoothing**: Automatically smooth your manually placed points using Catmull-Rom splines.
- **Path Extraction**: Convert your annotated path into a target for mechanism optimization.
- **Loop Closing**: Option to automatically connect the start and end points for cyclic motion.

### 📤 Export & Integration
- **SVG Export**: Export your mechanism and path as scalable vector graphics.
- **DXF Export**: Generate CAD-ready files for laser cutting or 3D modeling.
- **Presets**: Save and load your favorite mechanism configurations.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Designing a Mechanism
1.  **Select a Mechanism**: Choose from presets like "Crank-Rocker" or "Piston Pusher" in the left sidebar.
2.  **Modify**: Click "Draw Mode" to toggle interaction. Drag joints to resize or anchors to move.
3.  **Adjust**: Use the sliders in the sidebar for precise control over lengths and angles.

### Optimizing for a Path
1.  **Draw**: Enable "Draw Mode" and sketch a loop or curve on the canvas.
2.  **Select**: Click on the mechanism you want to fit to the path.
3.  **Optimize**: Click the "Optimize" button. The AI will iterate through variations to match your drawing.
4.  **Refine**: Adjust the optimization duration or seed mechanism for better results.

### Using Manual Tracking
1.  **Open Tracker**: Click the "Track Video" button in the controls.
2.  **Upload**: Select a video file or GIF containing the motion you want to replicate.
3.  **Annotate**: 
    - Click on the canvas to place a point.
    - Drag points to adjust them.
    - Use the timeline or arrow keys to move between frames.
4.  **Refine**:
    - Check "Smooth Path" to create a smooth curve through your points.
    - Check "Connect Ends" if the motion is a closed loop.
5.  **Transfer**: Click "Transfer as Drawing" to send the tracked path to the main editor for optimization.
